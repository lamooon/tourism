AI-Powered Visa Application Assistant for AWS Hackathon 2025

## Problem
Visa applications are confusing and time-consuming. Different requirements per country, repetitive form filling, and no centralized tracking. 
In Hong Kong where outbound travel is common, this inefficiency really hurts.

## Solution
AI-driven agent that automates the entire visa workflow:
- Policy Understanding — Scrapes official visa websites in real time
- Personalized Checklists — Generates tailored document lists and timelines
- Auto Document Handling — OCR + NLP to scan documents and auto-fill forms
- Status Tracking — Live embassy processing updates and deadline reminders

## Demo Flow
1. Select destination → AI shows requirements checklist
2. Enter travel details → AI determines visa type automatically
3. Upload documents → OCR extracts data, pre-fills forms
